# Pancake POS MCP

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server wrapping the Pancake POS REST API, enabling AI assistants like Claude to manage Vietnamese e-commerce POS operations with 24 specialized tools and 7 reference resources.

## Overview

Pancake POS MCP exposes the Pancake POS API (https://pos.pages.fm/api/v1) as Model Context Protocol tools, allowing Claude and other AI assistants to automate POS management across:

- **Core POS:** Orders, Products, Customers, Inventory
- **Supply Chain:** Warehouses, Suppliers, Purchases, Transfers, Stocktaking
- **Sales:** Returns, Exchanges, Combos, Promotions, Vouchers
- **CRM:** Contacts, Deals, Activities
- **Multi-Channel:** eCommerce (Shopee/Lazada/TikTok), Livestream Commerce
- **Operations:** Employees, Webhooks, Analytics, Shop Info, Address Lookup

## Prerequisites

- **Bun** (runtime) — install from https://bun.sh (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)
- **Pancake POS API Key** + **Shop ID** — see [Getting Pancake POS credentials](#getting-pancake-pos-credentials) below. Note: this is the **Pancake POS** (e-commerce / inventory) API, not the Pancake user/social-inbox API — different products, different keys.
- **Node.js 18+** (optional, for development tooling)

## Quick Start

Get from zero to a working MCP server in ~5 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/nguyennguyenit/pancake-pos-mcp.git
cd pancake-pos-mcp

# 2. Install dependencies
bun install

# 3. Configure credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in PANCAKE_POS_API_KEY + PANCAKE_POS_SHOP_ID
# (See "Getting Pancake POS credentials" section below)

# 4. Verify it runs
bun run src/index.ts
# Expected output:
#   [pancake-pos-mcp] Server started on stdio transport
# Press Ctrl+C to stop.

# 5. Connect Claude Desktop — see "Stdio Transport" section below
```

If step 4 prints an error, double-check your `.env` values and that you ran `bun install`. Common issues are listed in [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Getting Pancake POS credentials

> ⚠️ **Pancake POS** ≠ **Pancake (social inbox)**. This MCP only works with the **Pancake POS** product at https://pos.pages.fm — the e-commerce / inventory / order-management system. The Pancake user/inbox API at `pages.fm` is a different product with a different API key and is not supported here.

You need two values from your Pancake POS account:

1. **`PANCAKE_POS_SHOP_ID`** — the numeric ID of your shop
   - Log in to https://pos.pages.fm and check the URL or shop settings to find the numeric shop ID
2. **`PANCAKE_POS_API_KEY`** — your Pancake POS API token
   - Pancake POS Dashboard → **Cài đặt** (Settings) → **API** → **Generate API key**
   - Copy the key immediately — it is only shown once

> Keep both values secret. Never commit them to git. The `.gitignore` already excludes `.env` and `.dev.vars`.

## Configuration

Required (set in Quick Start):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PANCAKE_POS_API_KEY` | Pancake POS API token |
| `PANCAKE_POS_SHOP_ID` | Numeric shop ID |

Optional:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PANCAKE_POS_BASE_URL` | `https://pos.pages.fm/api/v1` | Override API endpoint |
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP transport port |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | _(none)_ | Bearer token for HTTP/Workers auth |

## Usage

### Stdio Transport (Claude Desktop)

Default mode. Add to Claude Desktop config `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pancake-pos": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/path/to/pancake-pos-mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Transport (Remote Access)

Enable Streamable HTTP transport:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts --http
```

Server starts at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`. Health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`

With authentication (recommended for production):

```bash
# .env
PORT=3000
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=your_secret_token

# Client usage
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_secret_token" http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

### Cloudflare Workers (Serverless Edge)

Deploy globally on Cloudflare Workers for low-latency access from anywhere:

```bash
# Local development (uses .dev.vars for secrets)
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
# Edit .dev.vars with your credentials
bun run dev:workers
# Runs at http://localhost:8787

# Deploy to Cloudflare
wrangler login
bun run deploy

# Set production secrets
wrangler secret put PANCAKE_POS_API_KEY
wrangler secret put PANCAKE_POS_SHOP_ID
wrangler secret put MCP_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Workers URL: `https://pancake-pos-mcp.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp`

**Connect Claude Desktop via mcp-remote:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pancake-pos": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://pancake-pos-mcp.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp",
        "--header", "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Workers characteristics:** 8s timeout per upstream call, 2 retries, rate limiter disabled (stateless per-request model). Free tier: 100k requests/day. See [deployment guide](./docs/deployment-guide.md) for full details.

## Troubleshooting

A few non-obvious gotchas:

- **`429 Too Many Requests`** — hit Pancake rate limit (1000/min, 10000/hour). The built-in token bucket auto-throttles; reduce parallelism on the caller side.
- **Tests fail with `Cannot find package 'cloudflare:test'`** — use `bun run test` (vitest), not native `bun test`. Workers tests need the vitest pool worker plugin.
- **Claude Desktop doesn't see the tools** — the `command`/`args` path in `claude_desktop_config.json` must be absolute. Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config.

For other errors, check the error message and verify `.env` credentials.
